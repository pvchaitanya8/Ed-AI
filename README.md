## 🔐 Creating the `.env` File

To secure sensitive information such as API keys, follow these steps to create and configure a `.env` file:

1. **Create the `.env` File:**

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

2. **Add Configuration Variables:**

   Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor and add the following line:

   ```

   > **Note:** Replace `your-gemini-api-key-here` with your actual Gemini API key.

3. **Secure Your `.env` File:**

   Ensure that your `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent it from being pushed to version control:

   ```
   # .gitignore
   .env
   ```
