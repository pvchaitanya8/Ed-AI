**Difficulty:** Easy

**Description:**

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

**Assumptions:**

- Each input will have exactly one solution.
- You cannot use the same element twice.

**Examples:**

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
Output: [1, 2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3, 3], target = 6
Output: [0, 1]
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `-109 <= target <= 109`
- Only one valid answer exists.

**Note:** This is a common LeetCode problem that serves as a good introduction to array and two-pointer problems.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Consider using a code block to demonstrate a possible solution or algorithm.
- If you have multiple approaches, you can discuss their time and space complexities.
- Provide relevant links to resources or discussions for further exploration.
