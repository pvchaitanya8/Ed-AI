                        1. **Exclusion of Completed Courses:** Only include courses where `"Completed": false`.
                        2. **Order of Difficulty:** Arrange the recommended courses from easiest to hardest based on their topics.
                        3. **Selection When All Courses Are Completed:** If all courses are marked as completed, select any 8 courses that are most suitable.
                        4. **Output Format:** The recommendations should be a list of "Image Box" identifiers, strictly adhering to the format below.

                    **Input JSON:**
                    ```json
                        {data}
                    ```

                    **Additional Notes:**
                        - Ensure that the list strictly contains only the "Image Box" identifiers.
                        - Maintain the sequence from the easiest to the most challenging topics.
                        - Do not include any courses that have `"Completed": true`.
                        - If all courses are completed, select any 8 courses that best fit the recommendation criteria.
                        - Adhere strictly to the expected output format without deviations.
