      ],
      "answer": "By setting high to mid when the target is greater than mid",
      "explanation": "Binary search adjusts the search bounds based on comparisons: if the target is less than the mid element, it narrows the search to the lower half; if greater, it narrows to the upper half.",
      "incorrect_explanation": {
