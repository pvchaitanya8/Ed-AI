**Problem Statement:**
Given a string `s`, your task is to find the longest palindromic substring in `s`. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

**Input:**
- A string `s` (1 <= len(s) <= 1000)

**Output:**
- Return the longest palindromic substring of `s`. If there are multiple such substrings with the same length, return the first one.

**Example:**
**Example 1:**
**Input:**
```
babad
```

**Output:**
```
bab
```
(Note: "aba" is also a valid answer, but "bab" occurs first.)

**Example 2:**
**Input:**
```
cbbd
```

**Output:**
```
bb
```

**Constraints:**
- The input string will consist of only lowercase English letters.
