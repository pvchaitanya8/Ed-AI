Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most `k` distinct characters.

**Example**

**Example 1:**
Input:  
`s = "eceba"`  
`k = 2`  
Output:  
`3`  
Explanation: The substring is `"ece"` with length 3.

**Example 2:**
Input:  
`s = "aa"`  
`k = 1`  
Output:  
`2`  
Explanation: The entire string consists of 1 distinct character.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= k <= s.length`
- `s` consists of English letters.
