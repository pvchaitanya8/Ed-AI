**Problem Statement**

You are given an array of integers. Your task is to find the sum of all elements in the array.

**Input**

- The first line contains a single integer `n`, the size of the array.
- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the array elements.

**Output**

- Output a single integer, which is the sum of all the array elements.

**Example**

**Example 1**
Input: 5 1 2 3 4 5

Output: 15


**Example 2**
Input: 3 -1 2 3

Output: 4


**Constraints**

- \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)
- \( -10^3 \leq a_i \leq 10^3\), where \(a_i\) is the ith element of the array.
