To Whom It May Concern (or whoever is lucky enough to read this),

Let's be honest, you're probably sifting through a mountain of cover letters right now, each one as thrilling as a tax audit. So, I'll get straight to the point: I want to work at Google. And not just because it's Google, but because I genuinely believe I can bring something unique to the table (besides my uncanny ability to win at Google Doodles).

I've always admired Google's innovative spirit. You're not just a company, you're a pioneer, constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible. And that's exactly the kind of environment I thrive in. I'm not afraid to take risks, challenge the status quo, and occasionally break a few things in the process (don't worry, I'm also good at fixing them).

In my previous role at [Previous Company Name - *Please insert your previous company*], I [Insert a funny but relevant achievement.  For example: "single-handedly increased office morale by 150% by introducing 'Motivational Mondays' featuring interpretive dance."  *Please insert your own funny but relevant achievement*]. I'm also proficient in [List your skills, but make them sound interesting. For example: "Python (I can charm snakes with it), JavaScript (I can make websites dance), and Project Management (I can herd cats...mostly)." *Please insert your own skills and make them sound interesting*]. But more importantly, I'm a team player, a problem solver, and a lover of all things Google (yes, even Google+).

I'm confident that I have the skills and the passion to make a real contribution to your team. And who knows, maybe I'll even come up with the next big Google Doodle. So, if you're looking for someone who's not afraid to think outside the box (or inside a Google-branded one), I'm your person.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I eagerly await the opportunity to discuss how I can help Google continue its reign of awesomeness.

Sincerely,
Todo
